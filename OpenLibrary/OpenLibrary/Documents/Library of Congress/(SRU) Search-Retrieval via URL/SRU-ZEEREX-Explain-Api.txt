THIS APPEARS TO BE AN SRU REQUEST:  (See sruRequest.xsd) or, probably SRU 1.2 (https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/sru-1-2.html)

Explain Operation

The Explain operation allows a client to retrieve a description of the facilities available at an SRU server. 
It can then be used by the client to self-configure and provide an appopriate interface to the user. The record 
is in XML and follows the ZeeRex Schema.

There are two methods for getting the explain record:

    Via the SRU Explain Operation. 
    Via the http GET request at the base URL for the service (no parameters).
    This can be considered an SRU request (and hence have a default recordPacking of 'xml'), with no extraRequestData 
    and leaving it up to the server to determine the version of the response.
    Otherwise, the response is identical to an SRU explainResponse message.
